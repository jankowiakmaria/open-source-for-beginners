# Contributing

To make this repo a bit different, the suggested links should ideally be links to projects that you've contributed to, so have an idea of how accessible the project may be to a junior developer. Otherwise, add repos with specific labels such as "beginner," "starter" etc.

To submit a new repo suggestion, please follow the format of the existing entries e.g.

<pre>
### Category
* [Repo](link)
</pre>

For some links it might be useful to provide a blurb to go along with the link,

<pre>
### Category
* [Repo](link): blurby blurb
</pre>

Try to order the links in alphabetical order.

Where possible place the new link under an existing category heading.
